# Budget Tracker

A simple CLI-based budget tracker application designed to help manage personal finances efficiently. 
This project allows users to add and delete transactions across different categories, track their 
income and expenses, and get visual insights into their budget distribution. It uses the JSON library
to maintain data persistence between sessions.

## Features

- Add/Delete Transactions: Track income, expenses, and savings in different categories like Rent, Groceries, Transport, etc.
- Data Persistence: Stores all transaction data in a `JSON` file to ensure that information is not lost between sessions.
- Visual Representation: Displays a pie chart and line graph to provide an overview of income and expense distribution.
- Error Handling & Input Validation: Basic error handling is included to guide user input effectively.
